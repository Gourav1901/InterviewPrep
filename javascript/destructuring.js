// Destructuring in JavaScript is a convenient way to extract values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. It allows you to unpack the values or properties into separate variables with a clean and readable syntax.

const numbers = [1,2,3];
const [a,b,c] = numbers;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
